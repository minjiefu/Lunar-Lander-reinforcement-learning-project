# Title
Virtual Lunar Lander - A Reinforcement Learning Environment provided by Open AI Gym

# Purpose
This project implemented Deep Q-Learning Algorithm with a Q-network, and successfully trained the agent to autonomously navigate and safely land a virtual lunar lander on a designated landing pad on the moonâ€™s surface

# Highlights
- Employed techniques including Target Network and Experience Replay to enhance training stability 
- Earned a score of 200 points in 534 episodes, and effectively solved the environment
- Visualized the total point history along with the moving average
